# Merchify — Next.js Starter Skeleton

This repository contains a minimal Next.js skeleton for the Merchify project with placeholders for:
- Mux video upload + thumbnails
- Gemini (Nano Banana) image generation
- Shopify Storefront integration

Follow the `merchify-plan` docs for task assignments and sprint plan.

Quick setup:

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill your keys.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes: This skeleton contains API route stubs and frontend components to connect the flows. Replace placeholder logic with your real API calls and secrets.
